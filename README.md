# Pixel Landing Page
## by Audinot

*Project start date: 01.22.2022*

[live demo](https://audinot.github.io/landing-page)

This is the TOP landing page project, recreated as faithfully as possible
based on their provided design. Although there are many custom solutions, I
tried to stay as close as possible to the project images to practice
building things from a given design.

The page is not designed for mobile, **as per the project directions.** This
is intentional. However, I have tried to make it as flexible as possible
using Flexbox.

Each piece of the page was built as a separate standalone div. In the future
I would try to refine the content to keep the HTML smaller and neater.
