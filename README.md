# Odin Landing Page
## by Audinot

*Project start date: 01.22.2022*

[live demo](https://audinot.github.io/landing-page)

This is the TOP landing page project, recreated as faithfully as possible
based on their provided design. The page is not designed for mobile, **as per the project directions.** This is intentional. However, I aimed to make it as mobile-friendly as possible using only the tools given for the project - HTML, CSS, and Flexbox, with no media queries!

### Achievements

* Followed design very accurately
* Mobile-first design built with Flexbox
* Flexible design with no media queries required
