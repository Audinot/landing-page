# Pixel Landing Page
## by Audinot

*Project start date: 01.22.2022*

[live demo](https://audinot.github.io/landing-page)

This is the TOP landing page project, recreated as faithfully as possible
based on their provided design. I tried to stay as close as possible to the
design to practice building things from a given design, but I changed the font
to Gill Sans because it looked nicer to my eyes. I'm sorry, TOP.
